I've also started practicing meditation during my breaks to help manage stress. But sometimes, it feels like no matter what I do, I can't catch a break. It's been a constant struggle. [/INST] It's great to hear that you're already implementing some helpful strategies. Remember, progress takes time, and it's okay to have setbacks.

[/INST] It's completely normal to feel that way, but remember, asking for support is a strength, not a weakness. Start by scheduling a conversation with your supervisor or a trusted colleague in a private and comfortable setting. Be honest about your challenges and express your willingness to find solutions together. Remember, you're not alone in this. </s><s>[INST] Thank you for your understanding and guidance. I appreciate the reminder that I don't have to face this alone. I'll gather my courage and initiate that conversation soon. I need to prioritize my well-being and find a healthier balance.

Remember to be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. You've got this! </s>\"}"
